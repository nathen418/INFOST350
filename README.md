# INFOST350
A repo of all the code written for my **Introduction To Application Development (INFOST350) Fall 2021** class at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. Kept as an archive. The assignment sheets and instructions for all code are not shared, only sample code answers. This code has only been made available after the completion of the course.

## License

- I'm not a legal person so as long as I am credited in a somewhat obvious location, by my name or a link to this repository, I'm ok with it. If my name is not at the top of the file in a comment, it was not written by me and is only in this repo to serve as an example of something I was using for help. If my name does not appear on the file in a comment at the top, then it is not my code, it is class material.  If you have a problem with any of this, refer to my discord server and dm me.
